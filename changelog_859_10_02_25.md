# Minecraft Network Protocol Docs 10/2/25
For r21_u12, Network Protocol Version 859

## Dev Notes
We introduced a new metadata system to improve documentation generation. This system includes a `json` folder that leverages JSON Schema to provide a clearer description of packet structures. Using this schema, we also generated new HTML pages (`docs`) for packets and enums, consolidating all relevant information into a single, comprehensive HTML table. This approach replaces our existing SVG diagrams. So far, we’ve rolled this out to 154 packets, with plans to transition the rest in the coming releases.

## New Packets 
  - GraphicsParameterOverridePacket (331) [docs/GraphicsOverrideParameterPacket.html]

## Modified Packets
 * ShowStoreOfferPacket
   * Offer ID uses the underlying UUID object over a string, alligning with other uses of mcid::uuid.

 * CameraInstructionPacket
   * Added bool for splines in the camera instruction packet
   * Added data options to spline camera instruction (time, curve, keyframes)
   * Added 'attach_to_entity' and 'detach_from_entity' camera commands for 'minecraft:fixed_boom' and 'minecraft:follow_orbit' presets. Accessible under the Experimental Creator Cameras experimental toggle.
